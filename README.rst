============

Welcome to `AsyncAkumuli <https://github.com/smurfix/asyncakumuli>`__!

This library contains a small async wrapper for submission of data to
`Akumuli <https://akumuli.org>`__.

Also included:
* a utility to read the last timestamp, as Akumuli doesn't go backwards
* helper code to interpred RRD / collectd input so that you can feed those
  to Akumuli
* a couple of example scripts
